## NixOS-Config

This is a work in progress of my NixOS configuration.

## Installation
On NixOS, run `nixos-rebuild switch` to install the configuration specified here
and make it the boot default.

## dot-files
While I have tried to port dot-files over to a purely Nix config, xmonad (and
perhaps more applications in the future) is still configured via the dot file
specified in [my dot-files repo](https://github.com/blake-wilson/dot-files).
